## OpenCore EFI for Lenovo Y50-70 (UHD 4K) updated for Big Sur

### For FHD Version go to https://github.com/GeekyCoder7/OpenCore-EFI-Lenovo-Y50-70
### For installing BigSur use PRE-EFI.
### After installation, use POST-EFI.



### Updated to OpenCore 0.6.6
### Updated kexts

**Specs:**
  - Intel Core i7-4710HQ
  - Intel HD4600 integrated GPU
  - Nvidia GTX 860M 4GB (unsupported)
  - 16GB DDR4 Ram

 Before updating any kext create pendrive copy of actual EFI so if something wont
 work you can restore it.

Notes: 
- In order to use iMessage and Facetime you need to change your SMBIOS, with GenSMBIOS.<br>
Link: https://github.com/corpnewt/GenSMBIOS <br>
- updated SMBIOS to macbookpro11,4, Thanks to geekycoder7
- added BCM94350ZAE as it was cheap (round about 5â‚¬ at ebay), fully working, need unlocked BIOS for whitelisting and needed to set ASPM for PCI Express Slot 2 to L0 in BIOS to solve Quirks
- DVMT prealloc has to be set to 128mb
- after updating to OC 0.6.6 you need to reset NVRAM
  I needed to rename bootmgfw.efi in EFI/MICROSOFT to bootmgfw1.efi once, so that OC is detected. After that I renamed back and with new OC it shouldn't be the case in future
